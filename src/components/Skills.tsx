				Before I started learning React, I already had some programming experience. Iâ€™ve been writing code since 2017, starting with simple tools in Python, then building web apps
				from 2019 and iOS projects from 2025. I started with Python and Flask, then moved to JavaScript with Svelte, and later learned Swift to write native iOS apps.
